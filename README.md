## Introduction

Extubation failure remains a significant challenge in critical care, particularly for high-risk patients where resource constraints often limit access to advanced respiratory support such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). This study proposes an explainable machine learning model to predict the success of conventional oxygen therapy (COT) in high-risk patients post-extubation, utilizing data from the MIMIC-IV database. Focusing on a cohort of 10,567 patients meeting traditional high-risk criteria yet managed with COT, we aim to identify key predictors of extubation successâ€”defined as no re-intubation, escalation to HFNC/NIV, or death within 3 days. Multiple machine learning algorithms will be compared for performance and interpretability using techniques like SHAP and PDP to elucidate critical factors. 

## Project Goal

By refining high-risk patient definitions and aligning model insights with clinical standards, this work seeks to enhance decision-making and optimize resource allocation in intensive care settings
