# Model Training and Bias Analysis

This repository provides code for training machine learning models. It also includes model explanations through plots and a bias analysis script.

## Files Overview

- **`model_for_multi.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for training SVM, NN, and KNN models.
- **`plot-*.py`**: Python scripts for visualizing model explanations.
- **`bias.py`**: Script for performing bias analysis.
- **`high-risk.py`**: predict high-risk patients outcome by pretrained NN model.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need to install the following dependencies:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `tensorflow` (for NN model)
- `jupyter` (for running the notebook)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow jupyter
